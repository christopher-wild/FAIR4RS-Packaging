## Introduction

One of the most challenging aspects of research is reproducibility. This necessitates the need to ensure that both research data and research software adhere to a set of guidelines that better enable open research practices across all disciplines. The recent adaptation of the original **FAIR** principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) means that research software can now also benefit from the same general framework as research data, whilst accounting for their inherent differences, including software versioning, dependency management, writing documentation, and choosing an appropriate license. This is commonly referred to as the FAIR4RS principles.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Can you recall a time when you have used someone else's software but encountered difficulties in reproducing their results? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Software packaging is one of the core elements of reproducible research software. In general, `software packaging` encompasses the process of collecting and configuring software components into a format that can be easily deployed on different computing environments.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Think about what a `package` is in general; you typically have a box of items that you want to post to someone else in the world. But before you post it for others to use, you need to make sure the package has things like: an address label, an instruction manual, and protective material.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Packaging Analogy

Using the analogy in the callout above, provide an example for each package attribute in terms of the software attribute.


:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

## Hint

The above callout should help you think about a few different possible analogies.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

1. Box of items: The software itself (source code, data, images).

2. Address label: Installation instructions specifying the target system requirements (operating system, hardware compatibility).

3. Instruction manual: User documentation explaining how to use the software effectively.

4. Protective materials: Error handling routines, data validation checks to safeguard the software from misuse or unexpected situations.

## Why Should You Package Your Software?

As we've touched on above, there are several benefits to packaging your software:

-  **Ease of installation**: Instead of manually copying individual files and setting configurations, users can install the collective package using a package manager with very few steps involved.

- **Standardisation**: Packaging enforces a standard structure and format for software, making it easier for users and developers to understand.

- **Research impact and collaboration**: From a research impact perspective, software packaging ensures reproducibility, accessibility, and ease of dissemination to the wider research community.

Once you have convinced yourself that packaging your software is right for your project, there are some important questions that you, as the developer, should consider before getting started:

- **Target Users**: Who are you building this package for? Beginners, experienced users, or a specific domain? This will influence the level of detail needed in the documentation and the complexity of dependencies you may need to include.

- **Dependencies**: What other Python libraries does your package rely on to function? What about hardware dependencies? Finding the right balance between including everything a user may need and keeping the package lightweight is important.

- **Testability**: How will users test your package? You should consider including unit tests and examples to demonstrate usage and ensure your code functions as expected.

-. **Scalability**: As your project and software grows in size and complexity, how can you effectively handle the increased modules, dependencies and distribution requirements? 

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, however, once you have thought about candidate solutions for these questions, you're in a good position to start packaging your software.

### Packaging in Python

The most basic directory structure of a Python package looks something like:

```
ðŸ“¦ my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ my_package/
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ pyproject.toml

where

- ðŸ“¦ `my_project/` is the root directory of the project.
- ðŸ“‚ `my_package/` is the package directory containing the source code.
- ðŸ“„ `pyproject.toml` is a configuation file for setting up the package, containing basic metadata.
```

Tools such as `setuptools` and `pip` use the `pyproject.toml` file to configure how the package is built, distributed, and installed. We'll cover `pyproject.toml` in more depth in the next couple of episodes.

### Optional: What is `__init__.py`?

At this point, it's worth discussing the use of the `__init__.py` file that you might have come across before when packaging. Historically, the `__init__.py` script has been used to mark a directory as a Python package, allowing the contained modules to be imported (note; the use of double under lines in Python, often abbreviated to `dunder` lines, signal that this script should be "hidden" from users, helping distinguish this script from others.) It also contains any initialisation code for the package. The directory's structure might look something like:


```
ðŸ“¦ my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ my_package/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ __init__.py
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ pyproject.toml
```

For instance, consider the times you have imported a package, such as [numpy](www.numpy.org). The ability to write:

```python
import numpy
```
is enabled by the modular structuring of the numpy package. This includes presence of the `__init__.py` file, which signals to Python that the directory is a package, allowing to import its content using the `import` statement. The complete `import numpy` statement then means Python searches for the `numpy` package  in its search path (`sys.path`) and loads its contents into the namespace under the name `numpy`. Packages that follow the folder structure above are often referred to as **regular packages**.

However, in Python versions >= 3.3, the concept of **implicit namespace packages** (see [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)) was introduced. Namespace packages are commonly used to split a regular Python package (as described above) across multiple directories, which ultimately means the `__init__.py` file is technically not required to create any Python package. For the purposes of this course, we will omit the use of the `__init__.py` script.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 2: Improving your project's packaging

The directory structure of the basic Python package shown above is a good starting point, but it can be improved. From what you have learned so far, what other files and folders could you include in your package to provide better organisation, readability, and compatibility?


:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

## Hint

Use the emoji folder structure above to get you started. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

A possible improvement could be to include the following to your package:

```
ðŸ“¦ my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ my_package/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ LICENSE
```

The most obvious way to improve the package structure is to include a series of unit tests in a `tests` directory to demonstrate usage and ensure your code functions as expected. The main benefit of a `README.md` file is to provide essential information and guidance about a project to users, contributors, and maintainers in a concise and easily accessible format. Similarly, the purpose of a `LICENSE.md` file is to specify the licensing terms and conditions under which the package's code and associated assets are made available to others for use, modification, and distribution.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Although we have touched on the core concepts of packaging in Python, including how to set up one using the `pyproject.toml` configuration file, we still need to learn about how to write the metadata and logic for building a package. The next episode of this course provides a brief overview of the history of Python packaging, and what is required to turn your own project into a package.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Reproducibility is an integral concept in the FAIR4RS principles. Appropriate software packaging is one way to account for reproducible research software, which involves collecting and configuring software components into a format deployable across different computer systems.

- Software packaging is akin to the packaging a box for shipment. Attributes such as the software source code, installation instructions, user documentation, and test scripts all support to ensure reproducibility.

- The purpose of a software package is to install source code for execution on various systems, with considerations including target users, dependencies, testability and scalability.
