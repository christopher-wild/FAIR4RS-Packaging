## Introduction

In previous episodes, we developed a basic Python package to demonstrate the importance of software reproducibility. However, a crucial question that we haven't addressed yet is: _how can we, as the developers, ensure that a change in our package's source code does not result in the code failing or behaving incorrectly?_ This is also an important consideration for when you are releasing your package.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

One of the pitfalls of packaging is to fall into poor naming conventions, even for scripts. For instance, how many times have you worked on scripts that was named `my_script_v1.py` or `my_script_final_version.py`? What were your main challenges with this approach, and what alternative solutions can you think of to circumvent this naive approach?

## Semantic Versioning

    <figcaption><em>The framework of semantic versioning is described by three version numbers, major, minor and patch</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>


The answer the question above is based on a concept called `versioning`. Versioning is the practice of assigning unique version numbers to different states or releases of a given package to track its development, improvements, and bug fixes over time. The most popular approach for Python packaging is to use the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) framework, and can be summarised as follows:

```
Given a version number X.Y.Z, where X is the major version, Y is the minor version and Z is the patch version, you increment:

X when you make incompatible API changes,

Y when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner,

Z when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. 


```

# Recall: API

An Application Programming Interface (API) is the name given to the way different programs or parts of a program to communicate with each other. It provides a set of functions, methods that can be used to interact with a piece of software or data services. Commonly, APIs are used within web-based applications to enable users to receive information from a given service, such as logging into social media accounts, creating weather widgets, or finding geographical locations. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The first version of any package typically starts at 0.1.0, and any changes following the semantic versioning rules above results in an increment to the appropriate version numbers. For example, updating a software from version (0.1.0) to (**1**.0.0) is called a `major` release. Version (**1**.0.0) is commonly referred to as the `first stable release` of the package.


An important point to highlight is the semantic versioning guidance above is a general rule of thumb. Exactly when you decide to bump the versions of your package is dependent on you, as the developer, to be able to make that decision. Developers typically take the size of the project into account as a factor; for example, small packages may require a patch release for every individual bug that is fixed. On the other hand, larger packages often group multiple bug fixes into a single patch release to help with tractability because making a release for every fix would accumulate in a myriad of releases, which can be confusing for users and other developers. The table below shows 3 examples of major, minor and patch releases developers made for Python. 


| Release Type  | Version Change | Description                                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Major Release | 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 | Introduced significant and incompatible changes, such as the print function and new syntax.  |
| Minor Release | 3.7.0 to 3.8.0 | Added new features like the walrus operator and positional-only parameters, backward-compatible. |
| Patch Release | 3.8.0 to 3.8.1 | Fixed bugs and made performance improvements without adding new features or breaking changes. |

# Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions in semantic versioning are versions of the software that are still in development or testing before a stable release. They are denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers to the version number, such as 1.0.0-alpha or 1.0.0-beta.1. These versions allow developers to release early versions for testing and feedback while clearly indicating their status.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Once we publicly release a version of our software, it is crucial to maintain consistency and avoid altering it retroactively. Any necessary fixes needs to be addressed through subsequent releases, typically indicated by an increment in the patch number. 
For instance, Python 2 reached its final version, 2.7.18, in 2020, more than a decade after the release of Python 3.0. If the developers decided to discontinue support for an older version, leaving vulnerabilities unresolved, they would have to transparently communicate this to their users and encourage them to upgrade.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Semantic Versioning Decision Making

Imagine you are a developer working on a Python library called `DataTools`, which provides various utilities for data manipulation. The library uses semantic versioning and is currently at version 1.2.3. You have implemented a new feature that adds support for reading and writing CSV files with custom delimiters.

According to semantic versioning, should you bump the version to `1.3.0`, `1.2.4`, or `2.0.0`? Explain your reasoning.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

## Hint

Think about whether the new feature introduces any breaking changes for existing users.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

According to semantic versioning, since the new feature adds functionality in a backward-compatible manner, the version should be bumped to `1.3.0`. This signifies a minor version increase.

# Versioning vs Version Control

Note; although they share similarities, you should not confuse software versioning and version controlling your software. The table below outlines some similarities and differences to help you differentiate them:

| Aspect       | Version Control                                                                                                 | Versioning                                                                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**  | Tracking changes, enhancing collaboration, and maintaining a history of revisions                               | Differentiating between various stages of software development or releases, ensuring clear identification of updates and changes |
| **Features** | Branching, conflict resolution, merging                                                                         | Version numbering, compatibility guidelines, and release notes                                                |
| **Example**  | Git                                                                                                             | Semantic Versioning                                                                                           |
| **Benefits** | Collaboration, code integrity, and project management                                                           | Communication of changes (major, minor, patch), transparency, and compatibility                               |
| **Challenges** | Managing conflicts and merges with multiple contributors, ensuring training for teams, and integrating within existing processes | Ensuring backward compatibility and avoiding confusion with version numbers that accurately reflect the changes |

## Dynamic Versioning using setuptools_scm

At this point, you might be thinking; "__Do I have to manually update the version number in of my package every time I release a new version?__" Thankfully, the answer is no. Often, the version number associated to your package will typically be in multiple locations within your project, for example, in your `.toml` file and separately in your documentation. This means that manually updating every location for every release you have can be extremely cumbersome and prone to human-error, and therefore, you should avoid manually updating your versions. Fortunately, the `setuptools` library we looked at in previous episodes can help us automate these tasks.

The most natural and simplest solution is to use [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools-scm) (abbreviated as Setuptools Semantic Versioning), which is an extension of the `setuptools` library. `setuptools_scm` simplifies versioning by dynamically generating version numbers based on your version control system (e.g. `git`). It can extract Python package versions using `git` metadata instead of having to manually declare them yourself. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You can install `setuptools-scm` using `pip install setuptool-scm`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Following the installation, we can then amend declare the `setuptools-scm` variables in our project's `pyproject.toml` file:


```toml

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=64", "setuptools-scm>=8"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools_scm]
version_file = "src/_version.py"

```

Let's break down the instructions above. As we've seen before, the `[build-system]` defines the build dependencies, ensuring `setuptools` and `setuptools_scm` are installed for building the project. When you run a build tool (like `pip` or `build`), it will first install these dependencies to handle the build process. The `[project]` section provides metadata about the project and its configuration. Notice that the `version` field is commented out to highlight that the version will not be statically defined, but instead, it will be dynamically determined by `setuptools_scm` in the line below that contains `dynamic = ["version"]`. Finally, `[tool.setuptools_scm]` specifically configures `setuptools_scm`. The `version_file` field should contain the path to where `setuptools_scm` will write the version information, though, be sure you substitute in the path of your own packge name.. By specifying a `version_file`, you instruct `setuptools_scm` to create or update this file with version information. For further details on the usage of `setuptools_scm`, you can refer to the [documentation](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Under its hood, `setuptools_scm` is designed automatically to integrate with Git, and by default, uses Git tags to manage version numbers. It looks at the Git history of your project and extracts the version number from the most recent Git tag. If no Git tags are found, it generates one for you. Overall, once you've set up `setuptools_scm` in your `pyproject.toml` file, the workflow to version bump your package will look like:



1. **Commit your changes**:
   - Add your changes and commit them in your Git repository.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your changes"
     ```

2. **Tag a new version**:
   - Create a new Git tag to bump the version (e.g., from `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0`):
     ```bash
     git tag v1.1.0
     ```

3. **Push the tag to your remote repo (e.g. GitHub)**:
  - Push the new tag to your remote Git repository if applicable:

     ```bash
     git push origin v0.1.0
     ```

4. **Rebuild/reinstall your package**:
   - When you build or install the package, `setuptools-scm` will automatically pick up the new version from the Git tag.
     ```bash
     pip install .
     ```
Following this, you can confirm your new version by, for example, looking into your `src/_version.py` file or printing your package's `__version__` attribute. Ultimately, this means that your package's Git tags, `__version__`, `pyproject.toml` and any other file containing your package version version will automatically updated and synchronised with each other. So when users or other developers are using your framework, they're able to accurately tracking any code changes and dependencies, allowing them to reliably recreate specific versions of your software at any point in time.

Although `setuptool_scm` is the most common and simplest tool for dynamic versioning, there are many alternatives that you may consider in your own project. These include:

1. [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) - this is a Python package and dependency manager, which also supports the latest PEP standards.

2. [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) - used for managing and publishing Python projects, and handling virtual environments and versioning. It's also best suited for multi-environment and cross-version testing setups.

3. [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) - a lightweight Python project manager designed to simplify dependency management and virtual environments. This is generally ideal for users looking for a streamlined workflow.
